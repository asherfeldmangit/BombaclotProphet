Orpheus Public Journal — Greydirge Job

• Blood Lord Berline Haldoli (necromancer) runs zombie farms near Greydirge.
• Hires party to fix Old Ergagh's farm: stop wandering zombies, salvage crops, locate missing foreman Brahdek, and discover cause of chaos.
• Threats: rogue zombies and "Moshmuta," an enormous, nearly unkillable zombie cow—avoid killing if possible.
• Clues: grain silos laced with pink-grey powder; corpses (little finger removed) wearing red cloaks; +1 ghost-touch scythe recovered.
• Reward: deed to abandoned building (Old Quallaqh) once farm restored.
• Motivation: Haldoli short-staffed, wants new allies.
